⚠️ This repository contains the original version of Medicoast, built using JSON-based storage and basic CLI structure during early development.
The project has now been fully restarted and upgraded with a modular architecture, SQL database, and modern web-based GUI using Flet.

➡️ Check out the new, scalable version of Medicoast here: New Medicoast Repository
It features multi-user support, AI-powered health summaries, and a production-ready structure.
